# Bioinformatic Pipelines data repository

## This repository contains data for the course called "An Introduction to Bioinformatic Pipelines for Population genomic and Metagenetic data analysis", which is offered at the Sven Lov√©n Centre for Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

### The material stored here will be used during the population genomics part of the course (Part III). 

### Day 1 (morning), we will use the RAD_materials, to simulate an analysis of 2b-RAD data. For this exercise, you will need to download the folder called RAD_materials onto the remote server and unzip the data files (under "/data").
### You do this by moving into the data folder, then typing: "gunzip *.gz"

### In the afternoon of day 1, we will start analyzing the RNA-Seq materials, which we will then continue with on days 2 and 3. 

### Each of the folders contains one folder called data and one folder called scripts. We will be working from within the data folder and call the scripts/programs from the folder called scripts.
### On Thursday, we will also perform some simple analyses in R, R scripts and the DESeq package can be found in the R_scripts folder. These can be downloaded to your local computer.

### All exercise tutorials for these three days can be found in the exercises folder.

### You can easily download all the files found here to the remote server by (while being located in the right folder), typing:

### "git clone git@github.com:DeWitP/pipelines_2015.git"
